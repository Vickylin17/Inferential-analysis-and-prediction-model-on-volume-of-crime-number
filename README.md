**Brief Introduction to the Project:**

In this project, Communities and Crime Data Set acquired from UCI Machine Learning Repository by Michael Redmond is applied to examine the predictive question: For one specific state in US, California, among the factors of population density, young age rate, urbanization, income, poverty, education, unemployment, divorce rate and the number of people in a family, what variables can build up the best model to predict the total crime number? The data set includes real data from socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR, and contains a total number of 128 attributes and 1994 instances. In this study, our focus is predictive, and we will use the linear regression and LASSO models to do the prediction study.
